# S02P01 FOR EACH & IF STATEMENT

This project is my solution in **C#** to the **For Each & If Statement** practice found in section 02 practice 01 of the UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation course.

### GETTING STARTED

After making a pull request or downloading the project, open the Main.xaml in UiPath Studio.  The robot can be run with the play button in the ribbon and the result can be seen in output panel.

### PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS

###### **Find the smallest and biggest numbers in an Array**

Use For Each, Assign and If Statements to find the minimum and maximum number in an array of Int32 elements and print it.

**Note**: You can instantiate the Array with {7, 5, 2, 4, 3, 9} or with your own values, as long as they are integers.

### DETAILS

**Course:** UiPath - RPA Developer Foundation

**Section:** 02 Variables, Data Types And Control Flow In Studio

**Practice:** 01 For Each & If Statement

**Project Format:** Windows, C#

**GitHub:** https://github.com/ShonHarsh/RPADev-S02P01-ForEachIfStatement

### SAMPLE OUTPUT

```

07/16/2021 14:07:26 => [Info] RPADev-S02P01-ForEachIfStatement execution started
07/16/2021 14:07:28 => [Debug] The smallest value is: 2. The larges value is: 9.
07/16/2021 14:07:28 => [Info] RPADev-S02P01-ForEachIfStatement execution ended in: 00:00:01
```

### ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

A standard UiPath, Studio to Orchestrator cloud setup is the base of operation.  It is easy to setup and free.
1. An Orchestrator connection - Visit https://cloud.uipath.com/ and authenticate or sign up.
2. [UiPath Studio](https://www.uipath.com/product/studio) is used to run the robot.  Note that Studio Web can be used directly in Orchestrator but I recommend installing the Studio IDE application.
